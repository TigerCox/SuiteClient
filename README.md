The starter kit includes a working example app that puts all of the above to use.

## Get Started
 1. **Initial Machine Setup**  
First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#initial-machine-setup).
 2. **Clone the project**  
Open the command line of your choice and change to the directory where you'd like to start your project. Then clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-react-starter-kit.git your-project-name`.  
 3. **Change directory**  
`cd your-project-name`. - Change directories into your project's root directory (the project name you chose in step 2):
 4. **Install Node packages**   
`npm install`
 5. **Run the example app**  
`npm start`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, you'll want to keep the command line open at all times so that your code is rebuilt and tests run automatically every time you hit save. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
 6. **Review the example app.** This starter kit includes a working example app that calculates fuel savings. Note how all source code is placed under /src. Tests are placed alongside the file under test. The final built app is placed under /dist. These are the files you run in production.
 7. **Delete the example app files.** Once you're comfortable with how the example app works, you can [delete those files and begin creating your own app](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#i-just-want-an-empty-starter-kit). You can always refer to this repo for the example app code that you deleted.
 8. **Plop these files inside your .NET solution.** - However, important note: **DO NOT** add node_modules to your solution. Just like Nuget, these files shouldn't be checked in. 
 9. **[Enable CORS on the APIs](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-react-starter-kit#how-do-i-call-our-existing-web-apis) you need to call** 

##Initial Machine Setup
 1. **Install [the newest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
 2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.  The recommended defaults are fine.
 3. **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Browser-sync (and various other Node modules) rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.  
 4. **Install C++ Compiler**. Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).
 5. **Install [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)** in Chrome. (Optional, but helpful)
 6. **Configure your Editor for React**. [Install the appropriate plugin](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Complementary-Tools#jsx-integrations) and [configure your editor](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/how-to-configure-text-editors.md).
 7. **Add two lines to your [Windows hosts file](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/modify-your-hosts-file)** for motosnap.com: 
```
127.0.0.1 motosnap.com
127.0.0.1 www.motosnap.com
```
The api configuration example (in /src/api/api.js) assumes that you're running VinConnect and its APIs locally at motosnap.com, so these host entries make sure cross origin calls like this succeed: `motosnap.com/CarDashboard/API/CRMServiceBase/v1/customers/attachments/list?customerId=212746634`

##FAQ
###Why does this exist?
This starter kit implements best practices like testing, minification, bundling, and so on. It codifies a long list of decisions that you no longer have to make to get rolling. It also saves you from the long, painful process of wiring it all together into an automated dev environment.

###What command line should I use?
This kit works on both the Windows DOS command line or in Git Bash on Windows. Git Bash is installed along with Git. 

###How do I keep my app updated with the latest features of the starter kit?
Be sure to clone this repo to get started. Then, anytime you want to get the latest version of this repo, type `git pull` on the command line in the root of your project. This will merge in all updates.

###Can you explain the folder structure?
**Note that the files that start with a dot below will be hidden by default in Windows.** [Here's how to see them](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7). Or type `ls -la` in Git Bash.

###Where are the files being served from when I run `npm start`?
Webpack serves your app in memory when you run `npm start`. No physical files are written. However, the web root is /src, so you can reference files under /src in index.html. When the app is built using `npm run build`, physical files are written to /dist and the app is served from /dist.
 
###How is Sass being converted into CSS and landing in the browser?
Magic! Okay, more specifically, we're handling it differently in dev (`npm start`) vs prod (`npm run build`)

When you run `npm start`: 

 1. The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS
 2. Webpack bundles the compiled CSS into bundle.js. Sounds odd, but it works! 
 3. bundle.js contains code that loads styles into the &lt;head&gt; of index.html via JavaScript. This is why you don't see a stylesheet reference in index.html. In fact, if you disable JavaScript in your browser, you'll see the styles don't load either.
 
The approach above supports hot reloading, which is great for development. However, it also create a flash of unstyled content on load because you have to wait for the JavaScript to parse and load styles before they're applied. So for the production build, we use a different approach:

When you run `npm run build`:

 1. The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS
 2. The [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) extracts the compiled Sass into styles.css
 3. buildHtml.js adds a reference to the stylesheet to the head of index.html.
 
For both of the above methods, a separate sourcemap is generated for debugging Sass in [compatible browsers](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/using-source-maps-with-sass).
 
###I don't like the magic you just described above. I simply want to use a CSS file.
No problem. Reference your CSS file in index.html, and add a step to the build process to copy your CSS file over to the same relative location /dist as part of the build step. But be forewarned, you lose style hot reloading with this approach.

###How do I call our existing Web APIs?
This starter kit uses a Node based webserver (Webpack's dev server combined with Browsersync). This means you need to enable Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on any existing IIS hosted APIs so that you can call them from this kit's dev web server. Here's how:  

Add this to your API's Global.asax:
```c#
protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    EnableCrossOriginRequestsFromLocalhost(HttpContext.Current.Request);
}

/// <summary>
/// Enables calling IIS-based webservices on localhost from a separate webserver.
/// Useful for doing front-end development from a separate webserver such as a Node-based webserver.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="request"></param>
private void EnableCrossOriginRequestsFromLocalhost(HttpRequest request)
{
    if (!HttpContext.Current.Request.IsLocal) return;
    if (request.UrlReferrer == null) return; //can't set Access-Control-Allow-Origin header reliably without a referrer so just return. Referrer should always be set when being called from an app under development because the app under development's URL will be sent as the referrer automatically.
    var response = HttpContext.Current.Response;
    response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", request.UrlReferrer.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority));
    response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
    if (request.HttpMethod == "OPTIONS")
    {
        response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, PUT, DELETE");
        response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Accept");
        response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "1728000");
        response.End();
    }
}
```
The example project includes /api/api.js. This file uses Axios to make AJAX calls. It's recommended to centralize your API calls there. See the example in api.js. api.js properly sets the base url based on whether it's running locally, but be sure to add a hosts entry for motosnap.com (as outlined in the initial machine setup) to assure it works properly.

###What do the scripts in package.json do?
Unfortunately, I can't comment the scripts in package.json inline because the JSON spec doesn't support comments, so I'm providing info on what each script in package.json does here.  

| **Script** | **Description** |
|----------|-------|
| prestart | Runs automatically before start. Calls remove-dist script which deletes the dist folder. This helps remind you to run the build script before committing since the dist folder will be deleted if you don't. ;) |
| start | Runs tests, lints, starts dev webserver, and opens the app in your default browser. |
| open | Opens the app in your default browser. |
| lint:tools | Runs ESLint on build related JS files. (eslint-loader lints src files via webpack when `npm start` is run) |
| clean-dist | Removes everything from the dist folder. |
| remove-dist | Deletes the dist folder |
| create-dist | Creates the dist folder and the necessary subfolders. |
| build:html | Adds trackJS tracking script and copies to /dist. |
| build:sass | Compiles SASS, minifies, generates sourcemap, and stores in /dist. |
| prebuild | Runs automatically before build script (due to naming convention). Cleans dist folder, builds html, and builds sass. |
| build | Bundles all JavaScript using webpack and writes it to /dist. |
| test | Runs tests (files ending in .spec.js) using Mocha and outputs results to the command line. Watches all files so tests are re-run upon save. |
| coverage | Displays code coverage data based on the resulting ES5 code that was compiled by Babel. Writes report to /coverage. |
| open-coverage | Runs the code coverage and then opens it in your default browser. |

### I just want an empty starter kit.
This starter kit includes an example app so you can see how everything hangs together on a real app. To create an empty project, you can delete the following:  

 1. Components in src/components  
 2. Styles in src/styles/styles.scss  
 3. Delete files in src/businessLogic  

Don't want to use Redux? See the next question for some steps on removing Redux.

### Do I have to use Redux?
Nope. Redux is useful for applications with more complex data flows. If your app is simple, Redux is overkill. Remove Redux like this:

 1. Delete the following folders and their contents: actions, constants, reducers, containers, store
 2. Uninstall Redux related packages: `npm uninstall redux react-redux redux-thunk`
 3. Remove Redux related imports from /src/index.js: `import configureStore from './store/configureStore';`, `import App from './containers/App';` and `import { Provider } from 'react-redux';`
 4. Remove this line from /src/index.js: `const store = configureStore();`
 5. Delete components in /components and create a new empty component.
 6. Replace the call to `<Provider><App/></Provider>` in /src/index.js with a call to the new top level component you just created in step 5.

### Why are test files placed alongside the file under test (instead of centralized)? 
Streamlined automated testing is a core feature of this starter kit. All tests are placed in files that end in .spec.js. Spec files are placed in the same directory as the file under test. Why?
+ The existence of tests is highly visible. If a corresponding .spec file hasn't been created, it's obvious.
+ Easy to open since they're in the same folder as the file being tested.
+ Easy to create new test files when creating new source files.
+ Short import paths are easy to type and less brittle.
+ As files are moved, it's easy to move tests alongside.

### How do I view code coverage?
Code coverage is calculated and reported via Istanbul. To view your current code coverage, run `npm run open-coverage`. This will open a tab in your default browser which displays code coverage statistics. You can optionally update the npm script config to run your code coverage on the command line each time you hit save.

### How do I debug?
Since browsers don't currently support ES6, we're using Babel to compile our ES6 down to ES5. This means the code that runs in the browser looks different than what we wrote. But good news, a [sourcemap](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) is generated to enable easy debugging. This means your original JS source will be displayed in your browser's dev console. 
*Note:* When you run `npm start`, no JS is minified. Why? Because minifying slows the build. So JS is only minified when you run the `npm run build` script. See [more on building for production below](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#how-do-i-deploy-this).

Also note that no actual physical files are written to the filesystem during the dev build. **For performance, all files exist in memory when served from the webpack server.**. Physical files are only written when you run `npm run build`.

**Tips for debugging via sourcemaps:**  

 1. Browsers vary in the way they allow you to view the original source. Chrome automatically shows the original source if a sourcemap is available. Safari, in contrast, will display the minified source and you'll [have to cmd+click on a given line to be taken to the original source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19550060/how-do-i-toggle-source-mapping-in-safari-7).  
 2. Do **not** enable serving files from your filesystem in Chrome dev tools. If you do, Chrome (and perhaps other browsers) may not show you the latest version of your code after you make a source code change. Instead **you must close the source view tab you were using and reopen it to see the updated source code**. It appears Chrome clings to the old sourcemap until you close and reopen the source view tab. To clarify, you don't have to close the actual tab that is displaying the app, just the tab in the console that's displaying the source file that you just changed.  
 3. If the latest source isn't displaying the console, force a refresh. Sometimes Chrome seems to hold onto a previous version of the sourcemap which will cause you to see stale code.

### How do I deploy this?
Before committing, type `npm run build`. This will setup the project for production. It does the following:
* Minifies all JS
* Sets NODE_ENV to prod so that React is built in production mode
* Places the resulting built project files into /dist. (This is the folder you'll expose to the world).

### Why does the build use npm scripts instead of Gulp or Grunt?
In short, Gulp is an unnecessary abstraction that creates more problems than it solves. [Here's why](https://medium.com/@housecor/why-i-left-gulp-and-grunt-for-npm-scripts-3d6853dd22b8#.vtaziro8n).

### Why does package.json reference the exact version?
This assures that the build won't break when some new version is released. Unfortunately, many package authors don't properly honor [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), so instead, as new versions are released, I'll test them and then introduce them into the starter kit. But yes, this means when you do `npm update` no new dependencies will be pulled down. You'll have to update package.json with the new version manually.

### I'm getting an error when running npm install: Failed to locate "CL.exe"
On Windows, you need to install extra dependencies for browser-sync to build and install successfully. Follow the getting started steps above to assure you have the necessary dependencies on your machine.

### How do I kill the watch process on the Windows command line?
If you're in Webstorm, click the red x next to the terminal and then hit Alt+F12 to reopen the terminal. Unfortunately, Ctrl+C doesn't seem to work on the windows command line. (Another reason why I recommend using Git Bash).

### I can't access the external URL for Browsersync
To hit the external URL, all devices must be on the same LAN. So this means your dev machine needs to be on Wifi (since you likely can't connect any tablet or phone to Ethernet. If you dev machine is on wired ethernet, it's on a separate LAN from the Wifi so the two devices won't be able to communicate.
