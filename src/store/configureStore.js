//Without middleware, Redux only supports synchronous data flow. http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html

//To clarify, middleware simply lets us slap some behavior in between dispatching an action
//and the moment it reaches the reducer. You can do other things like log, crash report, route, and so on.
//Thunk middleware lets us dispatch() functions, (useful for handling ajax calls in reducers)
