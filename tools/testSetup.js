   This setting assures the .babelrc dev config (which includes
   hot module reloading code) doesn't apply for tests.
   But also, setting the environment to prod here
   assures that our tests are run against the
   production version of React which has 3 advantages:
   1. It runs faster
   2. It assures we're testing the final prod code (obviously)
   3. We don't have to pass all required PropTypes in our tests.
   If we set the environment to something other than production
   then we have to pass every required propType or propType warnings
   will litter our test results.

   However, it also has a downside:
   1. You won't see any PropType validation warnings, since the
   code is running in prod mode.
